The following list of FAQs is gathered from our development team's experience and from other user's feedback.  Feel free to let us know what troubles you are having.  

=== Problem 1: No CUDA Compatible Device Found ===
*Solution*: Install the latest drivers from NVIDIA.  Don't use the default Windows Driver that is automatically installed at start-up immediately after installing the new card.

=== Problem 2: My screen freezes ===
*Solution*: Use a dedicated GPU to run your simulation, if possible.  There is a known time-out issue when a GPU is attached to the monitor.   As an alternative, go to *gpumcml_kernel.h* and reduce *NUM_STEPS* as this parameter depends on how fast your graphics card is.
