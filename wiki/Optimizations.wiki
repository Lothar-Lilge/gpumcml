This section introduces the key terminology for understanding the NVIDIA GPU hardware and
its programming model. This learning curve is required to fully utilize this emerging scientific
computing platform for this and other related applications.

GPU-accelerated scientific computing is becoming increasingly popular with the release of an
easier-to-use programming model and environment from NVIDIA (Santa Clara, CA), called
[http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html CUDA], short for Compute Unified Device Architecture. CUDA provides a C-like programming
interface for NVIDIA GPUs and it suits general-purpose applications much better
than traditional GPU programming languages. However, performance optimization of a CUDA
program requires careful consideration of the GPU architecture.
