This tutorial aims to guide new users through the initial pain of setting up, compiling and running the source code.

== Step 0: Graphics Card Setup == 
Before you start, make sure that your graphics card is CUDA compatible (check Appendix A of the [http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/3_0/toolkit/docs/NVIDIA_CUDA_ProgrammingGuide.pdf CUDA programming guide]) and has a Compute Capability of between 1.1 and 2.0 (Fermi).  Note that atomic instructions are only supported on devices with a Compute Capability of at least 1.1.  

If you don't have a proper graphics card, we recommend purchasing the latest Fermi generation, such as [http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_gtx_480_us.html GTX 480].  However, ensure that your power supply is at least 600 W (with 6-pin & 8-pin power connectors) and the motherboard supports PCI-E 2.0 x 16.  

== Step 1: CUDA Setup ==
Then, just follow all the steps listed in the [http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/3_0/docs/GettingStartedWindows.pdf Getting Started Guide] from NVIDIA.
